# ASPular Notes Client

A simple angular client that uses the associated [server](https://github.com/Lunar-Dawn/ASPular-notes-server)
to list, read, and edit notes.

It's pretty basic for now, as with all frameworks there's a *lot* not learn,
much of it outdated. But the features it currently has are perfectly
functional. (It also hasn't had a design pass,
so the appearance is likely to change very drastically)

### Current Features

- Create notes to read in the future
- Delete notes when not needed anymore
- Edit existing notes
- A search system with tagging to categorise notes easier
